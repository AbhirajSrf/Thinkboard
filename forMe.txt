MongoDB-database

express- web framework, a ready to use toolbox for building web apps faster and more easily
#saves time
#Makes code cleaner and more organized
#Handles common tasks (like routing, error handling etc)

react- forntend library
#basics- components, useState or useEffect 

nodejs- runtime, allows to run js on server 
#normally js runs on client side but nodejs helps to run it on server

API(application programming interface)
Rest api- popular one
it uses HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)


BACKEND
npm init -y
npm install express (@--- for version)
npm install nodemon (for live server)
npm install mongoose 
npm i dotenv
npm i @upstash/ratelimit@2.0.5 @upstash/redis@1.34.9
npm i cors

ENDPOINT
Endpoint is a combination of url + http method that lets client to interact with specific resources

JSON helps APIs send and receive data in a structured way.
Key point to remember
❌ JSON does not fetch data
✅ JSON is the format used to transfer data
✅ fetch, axios, etc. are what actually fetch data

Simple analogy
API → Restaurant
Fetch/Axios → Waiter
JSON → Plate the food is served on 🍽️

How it works with APIs
Your app requests data from an API (using fetch, axios, etc.)
#The API responds with data
#That response is usually in JSON format
#Your app parses the JSON and uses the data

git add .
git commit -m "message"
git pust


MIDDLEWARE
Middleware is a function that runs in the middle between the request and the response, it works before response. It is used to auth check.

RATE LIMITING
Rate limiting is a way to control how often someone can do something on a website or app like how many they can refresh a page, request to an API, or try to log in.
-For example: only 100 requests per user every 15min
we can use upstash
 

FRONTEND (rafce)
npm create vite@latest
- react
 - js
npm install
npm run dev
npm i react-router
npm i react-hot-toast, (notification)react-hot-toast.com
npm i lucide-react, for icons
npm i axios
bg.ibleick.com

daisyUI.com - tailwindcss library 
npm i daisyui@ -D


CORS(cross-origin resource sharing)
it is a browser security rule. When a website tries to get data form another website -like your frontend calling  an API on a different domain - the browser might block it for a security reasons.
